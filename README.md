# json-dummy
A tool for generating dummy JSON data.

Check out the [demo here!](http://joselee.github.io/json-dummy)

json-dummy allows you to define a json structure, and name it. You can then use that name as a reference in other json structures. Unlike other json generation tools throughout the interwebs that require you to write obscure syntax to define the structure, json-dummy attempts to provide a friendly user interface, so you can quickly get the dummy data you need without studying the tool's documentation.

## Tools used to build json-dummy:
- [Faker.js](http://marak.com/faker.js/)
- [Angular.js 1.5](http://angularjs.org)
- [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/)

### Future
Implement UI with [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
